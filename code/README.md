# Mammography Preprocessing

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive approach to preprocessing mammography images, ensuring the data is prepared effectively for subsequent analysis or machine learning tasks. The objective is to optimize mammographic images by applying various enhancement techniques and extracting key features critical for downstream applications, such as cancer detection.

## Features
- **Image Normalization**: Standardizes image intensities to improve model performance.
- **Noise Reduction**: Implements advanced filtering methods to eliminate noise from mammographic scans.
- **ROI Extraction**: Detects and extracts regions of interest (ROI) using thresholding techniques.
- **Image Augmentation**: Enhances the diversity of the training data set using augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling.

## Project Structure
The primary file in this repository is:
- **Mammography_Preprocessing.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing all preprocessing steps, visualizations, and explanations.

## Requirements
To run the code provided in this project, you need to install the following dependencies:
- `Python 3.7+`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `opencv-python`
- `scikit-image`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: Ensure you have `Jupyter Notebook` installed and set up in your Python environment.



## Usage
1. **Load Mammography Images**: The notebook provides code to load and visualize mammography images from your dataset.
2. **Apply Preprocessing Techniques**:
   - **Normalization**: Enhances image quality by normalizing pixel intensities.
   - **Noise Reduction**: Removes artifacts and enhances key structures.
   - **ROI Detection**: Identifies and extracts important regions from images.
   - **Data Augmentation**: Increases the variety of images for robust training.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Compute essential features from images for model training.

## Example Workflow
1. **Load Image**: Import images using `OpenCV` or `scikit-image`.
2. **Preprocess**: Apply normalization and noise reduction.
3. **Extract ROI**: Use thresholding and contour detection for segmentation.
4. **Visualize**: Plot preprocessed images to verify the transformations.
5. **Augment**: Perform data augmentation to create a robust dataset.

## Results
- Visual examples of the original and preprocessed images are displayed in the notebook.
- Comparative analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the preprocessing techniques.

## Future Work
- **Integration with Deep Learning Models**: Incorporate preprocessing pipeline with CNN-based architectures for breast cancer detection.
- **Advanced Segmentation Techniques**: Explore the use of U-Net and other advanced models for improved segmentation.
